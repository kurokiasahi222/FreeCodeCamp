                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                    environment to provide
                    programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
                    of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model
                    (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form
                    and respond to user
                    events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>

                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language
                    resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
                    most Java expression
                    syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                    from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based
                    on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
                    prototype-based
                    object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                    dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports
                    functions without any
                    special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                    methods.</p>

            <article>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>
                <code class="language">
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");
                </code>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

            <article>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform
                    to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be
                    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
                    (uppercase) and the
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
                <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                <code>x = 42.</code>
                <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                    shouldn't use this variant.
                    With the keyword let. For example,</p>
                <code>let y = 13.</code>
                <code>let myString = "Hello World"</code>
                <code>let counter = true</code>
